# Advent of Code 2021

Nothing too fancy - just running examples of the Advent of Code 2021

## What You'll Need

- Node v16

Other dependencies may evolve as I complete other exercises, but I'm trying to do this with as few as possible.

## Days

These are the commands required to run each day's test

Day 1:

- Part 1: `node day01/countIncreases.js`
- Part 2: `node day01/slidingCountIncreases.js`
