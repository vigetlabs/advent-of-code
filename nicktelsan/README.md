# Advent of Code 2021

Nothing too fancy - just running examples of the Advent of Code 2021

## What You'll Need

- Node v16

Other dependencies may evolve as I complete other exercises, but I'm trying to do this with as few as possible.

## Days

These are the commands required to run each day's test

Day 1:  
`cd day01`

- Part 1:  
  `node countIncreases.js`  
  `go run countIncreases.go`
- Part 2:  
  `node slidingCountIncreases.js`  
  `go run slidingCountIncreases.go`
