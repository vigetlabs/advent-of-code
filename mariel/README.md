## Advent of Code 2021 how exciting!

The prompts/puzzles can be found at the [Advent of Code 2021](https://adventofcode.com/) website. Below is a list of the days with a link to the puzzle and the command to run the solution. To get going, just run `npm install`.

The input and puzzle text aren't included here [because of reasons](https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/comments/k99rod/sharing_input_data_were_we_requested_not_to/), but the text is easy to find and if you want to play just log in with GitHub and you'll get your own unique input. How fun!

### Day 1

- [Puzzle for part 1](https://adventofcode.com/2021/day/1)
- To run solution, `cd` into `day-01` and run in the command line: `node day-01-part1.js`
- To see part 2, you need to complete part 1. The puzzle is similar: use the same input but now instead of comparing an element against the immediately previous, you need to create and sum groups of 3 and compare each sum to the previous group's sum.
- To run solution: `cd` into `day-01` and run in the command line: `node day-01-part2.js`

### Day 2

- [Puzzle for part 1](https://adventofcode.com/2021/day/2)
- To run solution, `cd` into `day-02` and run in the command line: `node day2-part1.js`
- To see part 2, you need to complete part 1. The puzzle is similar: use the same input, but now you will need to calculate your aim in addition to depth, and your depth is calculated using your aim.
- To run solution: `cd` into `day-02` and run in the command line: `node day2-part2.js`
